The response body can be presented as JSON or text by clicking the toggle buttons below the `Body` tab. With the options to copy, fold as well as word wrap if needed, the GraphQL response body can be viewed and formatted as needed.

The response headers, cookies, and timelines for the response can be viewed by toggling through tabs. The `copy json` and `copy text` can be used to copy information in any format that is required.

The performance benchmarks listed on the response panel helps the user know more about API's performance traits. The first number being the status code returned, next being the response time of the API listed in milliseconds and last being the data transferred in kilobytes.
