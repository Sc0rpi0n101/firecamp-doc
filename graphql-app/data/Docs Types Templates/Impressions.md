@Vishwa Mehta After Nishchit's talk and reading through Postman collection. I feel we should be adding project management bits to getting started. Same framework though. These below are impressions, in which we can have small actions like creating your first project, your first module like stuff. Because before doing anything in Firecamp, the user will need to have a project and that's why this goes into `Getting Started`. 
(Delete it if you agree, otherwise let me know what you think)
