# Test you requests with multiple environments

To test your API requests using different varibales, params, and headers, Firecamp offers Environment Snippets to create multiple environments to better test your requests and switch between various development phases to test them.

## Prequisites 

In order to follow along with this Action, make sure you know:
- what environment snippets are
- how to set an environment snippet 

## Directions 

1. Navigate to the `Environment Snippet` drop down menu above the `URL Bar` and click on it to reveal the list of snippets you have created. 

2. Select `Manage Global Snippets` at the bottom of the list to create multiple testing environments for your requests.

3. Once you select that item from the menu, you will see a window pop up. You can now create various environment snippets for every stage of your development to test it out. 

As an instance, you can create dedicated testing environments by creating one snippet for `development`, one for `production`, and a separate one for `staging` of your project. 

5. Click on the `Add New Snippet` button in the top right of the Snippet Manager window and create a snippet for your project, for instance `development` and hit enter.

6. You will see the snippet appear in the left pane of the window. Select your newly created snippet and enter the details of your environment snippet, namely: `Key`, `Value`, and `Description`. 

7. Yu can select or unselect any key-value pairs later on in your testing phase to modify your testing environment. 

8. Create the rest of the snippets similarly and switch between them for a faster and smoother testing experience. 

How cool is that! Now that you know how awesome Environment Snippets are and how to test your requests using them, go ahead and learn more about syncing them across teams in our TeamSync Gesture.
