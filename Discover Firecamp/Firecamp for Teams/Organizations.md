Firecamp is built with collaboration and accessiblity in mind for teams working in an distributed environment. Therefore, Firecamp provides features to setup organizations and workspaces for inviting members into your team to build, test and deploy your API's faster.

## Organizations in Firecamp

Let's start understanding organizations through an overview of project management in Firecamp!

```
^ Organizations
    - There can be multiple organisations in Firecamp under a single account.
    - An organization can have multiple workspaces.
    ^ Workspaces + Members
        - Workspaces are collection of projects, environmental snippets and members.
        - Multiple members can be invited to collaborate on projects inside Workspaces.

        ^ Projects
            - A workspace can have multiple saved projects.
            - A project can have multiple modules with requests and files saved inside them.
```

Organizations can be your company, startup or venture which hosts several workspaces for different purposes with team members having access to them and working together in sync.
