### **What is Project Bar?**

How do you feel if you are developing or testing code with FirecampApp and suddenly you have to halt?

frustrated? annoyed?

Don't worry about it, Firecamp provides you a facility to save your endeavor. You just have to save your request in the Project bar.

Project Bar is an assemblage of your saved requests. It is placed at the left most corner of the FirecampApp.

Firecamp Project bar assembles requests in [project](https://firecamp.io/docs/firecamp/project-bar/project) or it's assosiative [module](https://firecamp.io/docs/firecamp/project-bar/module). Project and modules holds your analogous request in convenient manner.
