# Importing Projects to Firecamp

We at Firecamp understand developer's plight when exporting and importing projects to and from different platforms. We built Firecamp keeping flexibility and accessibility in mind. Hence, whichever 3rd party client or platform you were using before, we make sure that your transition to Firecamp is smooth and things just work out for you and your team. We call our import feature, the `Black Hole`.

Just drop in raw `file` or `JSON` from any supported platform, any specification or even URLs into the `Black Hole` and Firecamp will handle the heavy lifting for you. If you like to suggest support for other platforms or any improvements. You can open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/firecampapp/Firecamp/issues)

# Importing projects from raw JSON
To import your files and projects using JSON, drop the JSON file into the Import Zone `Black Hole` located on the homepage of the Firecamp app. This will import your project and subsequent modules, requests, and files in their relevant locations.

Alternatively, you can also import using the `Import Project` button in the sidebar. Click the button and in the dialog box that opens select the `Raw JSON` option from the toggle bar located on the top right. Here, you can paste your JSON content and import it to Firecamp.

# Importing projects from URL

To import your files and projects using a URL, hover over Import Zone `Black Hole` located on the homepage of the Firecamp app. This will trigger a bar to rise and show you options to `Import your project from URL or RAW`. Click the `URL` link to open a dialog box where you can type your URL in the input field and hit the enter key to import the project. This will import the project and subsequent modules, requests, and files in their relevant locations.

# Importing projects from file

To import your projects using a file, drag and drop your file over Import Zone `Black Hole` located on the homepage of the Firecamp app. This will detect the file if it's from a supported platform, import the project and subsequent modules, requests and files in their relevant locations inside Firecamp.

Alternatively, you can also import using the `Import Project` button in the sidebar. Click the button and in the dialog box that opens select the `File` option from the toggle bar located on the top right. Next, choose the file that you want to import by clicking the `Drop File Here` button or drag and drop your file into the screen.
