# Importing projects in Firecamp

We at Firecamp understand developer's plight when exporting and importing projects to and from different platforms. We built Firecamp keeping accessiblity and flexiblity for developers in mind. Hence, whatever 3rd party clients or platforms you were using before we make sure that your transistion to Firecamp is smooth and things just work. We call our import feature, the `blackhole`.

Just drop in raw files from any platform mentioned or any specification or even URL's. We will handle it. If you like to suggest support or improvement for this feature. You can open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/firecampapp/Firecamp/issues)
