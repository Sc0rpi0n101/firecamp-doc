# Saving your First Request

Saving requests and files in Firecamp is quite intituive. Much like what would you see in your own computer. This tutorial would help you work effectively with the projects in Firecamp and make sure that no data is lost. Saving requests in Firecamp is similar across apps, integrations and utilities. Hence, we will be taking the example for running a sample request in the API app and saving that request into a project.

## Prerequisites
- Creating your first project

## Directions
1. Open the `Firecamp` app. If not installed, read the installation instructions.

2. Click `API` button on the homepage to open the `API` app.
   - The API app in Firecamp defaults to the URL `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts` as we see in the URL bar. We will use this to make our sample request.

3. Click the `Send` button present in the URL bar to send a sample request, and inspect the response panel.

4. Since we want to save this request for later use, click the `Save` button next to the `Send` button in the URL bar. In the dialog box, that opens add a `title` and `description` in the input for your reference.

5. Select the project and the subsequent module you want to save the request in from the choices given. If Firecamp doesn't detect any projects, you will be prompted to create one. When done, click the `Save` button to save your request.

Awesome! This process is similar for all requests and files you would encounter in Firecamp.
