## Overview

The URL bar in the API app is the hub area for sending, saving and modifying requests.

The URL bar consists of 5 elements,
1. Method selection
2. URL field
3. Send button (Execute)
4. Save button
5. Environment badges

## Method Selection
Request methods are used by protocols like `HTTP` at the times of request to indicate the desired action that needs to be performed for a given resource. Firecamp supports several request methods that acts on requests made to the API endpoint. These are available for use in the API app through the dropdown list as follows:

- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- PUT
- DELETE
- HEAD
- OPTION
- PURGE
- LINK
- UNLINK

More information about request methods is availabe in the additional resources section.

## URL Field
Through the URL field, you can specify API endpoint on which the request will be made.

## Send Button (Execute)
The orange `Send` button in the URL bar executes/sends your request to the endpoint specified in the URL field with the parameters you configured.

## Save Button
The `Save` button in the URL bar saves your request to the project/module for future use by you or your team. Learn more about **Projects in Firecamp** and **steps to save your requests in Firecamp**.

## Environment Badges
The `Default` and `Project` environment snippets (if working inside a project) can be easily accessed as well as from the URL bar. You can toggle between different environments as per the usecase. Learn more about environment snippets.
