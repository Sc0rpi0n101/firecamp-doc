## Overview

The URL bar in the API app is the hub area for sending, saving and modifying requests.

The URL bar consists of 5 elements,
1. Method selection
2. URL field
3. Send button (Execute)
4. Save button
5. Environment badges

## Method Selection
Request methods are used by protocols like `HTTP` at the times of request to indicate the desired action that needs to be performed for a given resource. Firecamp supports several request methods that act on requests made to the API endpoint. These are available for use in the API app through the dropdown list in the URL bar. These are as follows:

- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- PUT
- DELETE
- HEAD
- OPTION
- PURGE
- LINK
- UNLINK

Learn more about Request Methods in the `Quick Method Selection` impression.

## URL Field
The API endpoint can be specified in the URL field. This is the endpoint on which the request will be made when the `Send` button is clicked. Learn more about **API endpoints**.

## Save Button
The `Save` button in the URL bar saves your request to the project/module for future use by you or your team. Learn more about **Projects in Firecamp** and **Steps to save your request in Firecamp**.

## Environment Badges
The `Default` and `Project` environment snippets (if working inside a project) can be accessed from the URL bar through the dropdown list. You can toggle between different environments or create new ones as per the usecase. Learn more about **Environment Snippets**.
