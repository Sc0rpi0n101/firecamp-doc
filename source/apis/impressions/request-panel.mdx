## Overview

The request panel in the API app is the one-stop hub for configuring requests to the API endpoint. Whether you are debugging your API or integrating 3rd party APIs, you can easily get started with Firecamp.

Through the `Request Panel`, you can configure several parts of your request. These are as follows:

1. **Body**
    - Quick method selection
    - Quick body type selection
    - Add multiple bodies
2. **Auths**
    - Quick auth type selection
3. **Headers**
4. **Params**
5. **Scripts**
6. **Config**
7. **Code snippets Generator**

Requests can be used to retrieve, add, delete, and update data as well as can be sent with a wide array of request methods, parameters, authorization details, and anybody data that is needed.

When you send a request, Firecamp will show the response from the server in the **`Response Panel`** with the functionality to view, format and copy the data received along with other information.
