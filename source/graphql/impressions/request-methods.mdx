## Overview

Request methods are used by protocols like `HTTP` at the times of request to indicate the desired action that needs to be performed for a given resource. Each of the request methods implements a different semantic and is made for different purposes. Additionally, some common features are shared by a group of them.

Guidelines suggest using a specific request method on a specific type of call made to the server/endpoint (though technically it is possible to violate this guideline, yet it is highly discouraged).

## Request Methods used in Firecamp

Firecamp makes use of request methods that acts on requests made to your GraphQL endpoint. In most GraphQL requests, POST is the request method that is being used.

- **POST** - The `POST` method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or modify the data.
- **GET** - The `GET` method is used to retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.
