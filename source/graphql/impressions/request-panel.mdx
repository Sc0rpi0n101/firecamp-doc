## Overview

The request panel is made up of playground, collections, explorer and the variables panel on the bottom.

Request panel is the area where you can craft, tinker and save your queries, subscriptions, and mutations in the GraphQL app. The playground is the base on which we can build your requests, with the help of collections and explorer.

## Passing Arguments in your queries

The panel below playground is the variable window which lets you add values to arguments passed easily in your requests. Say for this `GetSingleHistory` query where we pass the `id` parameter.

    query GetSingleHistory($id: ID!) {
      __typename
      history(id: $id) {
        id
        details
      }
    }

The value for `id` can be added below in the variables window for easier access while running your requests.

    {
      "id": "1"
    }

If you have more than one request that is passing parameters in the playground then you can assign specific values for them by just clicking on them and seeing the name change to that specific query down in the variables panel.
