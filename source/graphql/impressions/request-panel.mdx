## Overview

The `Request Panel` in the GraphQL app is the one-stop hub for crafting, configuring, and saving your queries, subscriptions and mutations.

Through the `Request Panel`, you can get access to several components available in the app. These are as follows:

1.  **Playground**
2.  **Explorer**
3.  **Collection**
4.  **Headers**
5.  **Schema Documentation**

When you send a query to your GraphQL endpoint, Firecamp will show the response from the server in the `Response Panel` on the right with the functionality to view, and copy the data received from the server along with other information.
