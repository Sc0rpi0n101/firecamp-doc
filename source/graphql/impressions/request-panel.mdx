## Overview

The `Request Panel` in the GraphQL app is the one-stop hub for crafting, configuring, and saving your queries, subscriptions and mutations. Whether you are debugging your API or integrating 3rd party APIs, you can easily get started with Firecamp.

Through the `Request Panel`, you can get access to several components available in the app. These are as follows:

1.  **Playground**
2.  **Explorer**
3.  **Collection**
4.  **Headers**
5.  **GraphQL Helper Documentation**

When you send a request to your GraphQL endpoint, Firecamp will show the response from the server in the `Response Panel` with the functionality to view, and copy the data received from the server along with other information.
