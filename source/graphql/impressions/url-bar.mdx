## Overview

The URL bar in the GraphQL app is the hub area for sending, saving and modifying requests.

The URL bar consists of 5 elements,
1. Method selection
2. URL field
3. Send button (Execute)
4. Save button
5. Environment badges

## Method Selection

Request methods are used by protocols like `HTTP` at the times of request to indicate the desired action that needs to be performed for a given resource. Firecamp supports request methods that act on requests made to the GraphQL endpoint. These are available for use in the GraphQL app through the dropdown list in the URL bar. These are as follows:

- POST (Most Used)
- GET
- PATCH
- PUT
- DELETE
- HEAD
- OPTION
- PURGE
- LINK
- UNLINK

Learn more about it in the `Request Methods` impression.

## URL Field
The GraphQL endpoint can be specified in the URL field. This is the endpoint on which the request will be made when the `Send` button is clicked. Learn more about **GraphQL endpoints**.

## Save Button
The `Save` button in the URL bar saves your request to the project/module for future use by you or your team. Learn more about **Projects in Firecamp** and **Steps to save your request in Firecamp**.

## Environment Badges
The `Default` and `Project` environment snippets (if working inside a project) can be accessed from the URL bar through the dropdown list. You can toggle between different environments or create new ones as per the usecase. Learn more about **Environment Snippets**.
