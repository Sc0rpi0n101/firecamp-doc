## Overview

Collections is a section inside the GraphQL app Control Panel that lets you organise your query payloads. You can save your queries for later to build, manage, and improve them better. It can be viewed as a library of your saved query collections grouped by three categories:

- Query
- Mutation
- Subscription

Learn more about query actions and how to save them to collections in Actions mentioned in the Additional Resources below.
