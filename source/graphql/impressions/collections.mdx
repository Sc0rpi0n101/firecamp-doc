## Overview

The `Collections` component in the request panel that lets you organise your queries that you have saved using the `Push to Collections` button in the `Playground`. Through Collections you can:

- Build from where you left off in the Firecamp app using the `Copy üìã` button
- Run the saved queries right from Collections using the `Play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è` button
- Organise your queries into 3 categories mainly, queries, and mutations helping onboarding new people easier on your teams.

`Collections` is a library of your saved queries grouped into categories available to run and modify when needed. Use `Push to Collections` button to save your **active query** into `Collections`. Later, navigate to the `Collections` tab to check them out.

Any query in the `Playground` becomes a **active query** when your typing cursor is set on it. Learn more about it in the `Playground` impression.
