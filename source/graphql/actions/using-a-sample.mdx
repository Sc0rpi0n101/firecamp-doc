# Using a sample

Created: Jan 26, 2020 3:48 AM

### Using a sample

### Prerequisites

- Environment snippet should be set

### Directions

1. Navigate to the 'Sample' button in the Request Panel and click it to import a pre-populated sample.
2. Press 'Enter' as the URL appears in the URL bar to generate data inside the Query Explorer.
3. Click on the checkboxes to select a key to build queries inside the GraphQL Playground.
4. Instead of manually writing the appropriate query syntax, use the tiny `Q`, `S`, and `M` buttons on the top right corner of the Request Panel to auto-complete the syntax for a Query, Subscription, and Mutation respectively.

Voila! Now you know how to use a sample to create your schema.
