## Prerequisites

In order to follow along with this Action, you must have:

- successfully configured a GraphQL end-point
- generated data inside the Explorer
- Build queries inside the playground

## Directions

1. Once you have a query you're confident in and want to save to use later, click the 'Push to Collection' button in the bottom right corner of the Playground.
2. Navigate to the playground to see your query saved inside the respective category of queries, namely- Query, Mutation, and Subscription.

Voila! Now you can manage your queries better and come back to them later to optimise, modify, fetch, run, or delete them later.
