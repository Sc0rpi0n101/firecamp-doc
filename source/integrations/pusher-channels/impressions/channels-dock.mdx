# Channels dock

## Overview 

The channels dock in your Pusher Integration is where all your saved channels are displayed under the category they belong to. 

There are three categories of Pusher channels, namely:

- Public 
- Private
- Presence 

You can learn more about the Pusher channel categories and what they mean from the official [Pusher docs](https://pusher.com/docs/channels).

You can access the saved channels from the Channels dock, open them, and run them later.
