# Firecamp Documentation 

Firecamp-doc is a tapestry of documentation pieces mindfully woven together show our developers a crisp picture of what Firecamp is in its entirety. 

Firecamp-doc is woven using three pivotal threads of documentation that empower our developers to understand Firecamp fundamentals and draw genuine value provided by Firecamp features. These three threads are: 

1. Impressions
2. Actions
3. Gestures 

The goal of Firecamp-doc is to take the developer on a seamless journey from understanding the key components of Firecamp, to learning how to achieve important tasks in Firecamp, to using Firecamp for a robust development experience.  

Each documentation thread is purposefully structured to serve a specific set of outcomes based on the level of expertise of our developers and what they are looking to achieve by reading Firecamp-doc. 

# Doing Docs the Firecamp-doc Way 

`Firecamp-doc` has been put together with a humanised methodology in mind, of getting utmost value out of our documentation experience in the least amount of time. It is a new approach to understand and read documentation. 

`Impressions`-->`Actions`-->`Gestures`

While it is not entirely impossible to follow along with these pieces without following the order, it is important to note that following the order of reading the docs does help you get a clear and seamless picture of Firecamp.
