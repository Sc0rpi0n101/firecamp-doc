#Firecamp Documentation 

FireDocs is a tapestry of documentation pieces mindfully woven together show our developers a crisp picture of what Firecamp is in its entirety. 

FireDocs is woven using three pivotal threads of documentation that empower our developers to understand Firecamp fundamentals and draw genuine value provided by Firecamp features. These three threads are: 

1. Impressions
2. Actions
3. Gestures 

The goal of FireDocs is to take the developer on a seamless journey from understanding the key components of Firecamp, to learning how to achieve important tasks in Firecamp, to using Firecamp for a robust development experience.
