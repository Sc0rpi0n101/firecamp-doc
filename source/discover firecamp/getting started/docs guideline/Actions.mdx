# Actions

The `Actions` thread in FireDocs is a set of mindfully crafted documentation pieces that enable you to learn how to perform specific tasks in `Firecamp`. It is a personalised piece that is focused on giving you a quick, hand-on, and actionable experience. Being developers ourselves, we understand the preferences of developers with deadlines. With `Actions`, we enable you to learn and emulate tasks smoothly while on a time crunch.
