Projects in Firecamp helps you save, organize, and share requests created by the user. So, instead of searching for requests you made for your API, you can focus on the actual testing itself. Projects are collection of modules, requests and files that are created inside Firecamp. To save requests in Firecamp, you need to have a project first.

Modules can be thought of as sub-directories that you can create in your Firecamp project. One can use modules to organize, manage and group similar requests, files, and even add more modules for easier access. Let's start by creating our first project.

Requests in Firecamp can be created off the WebSockets, the GraphQL or the API app. Requests also include integrations such as Ably or Pusher Channels, Socket.io etc. Requests include all elements of the request upon saving. From environment snippets used to endpoints to configurations made etc.

Files in Firecamp are created when saving outputs of utilities such as the JSON/XML/YAML Smart Converter and the Markdown Editor.

## Creating a new project

1. Open the Firecamp app. If not installed, read the installation instructions.

2. If you haven't logged into Firecamp, login by clicking the `Signin` on the top right. Signing in would help you and your team to keep projects in sync and easier to manage between team members. Once done, Firecamp will sync all projects, modules and environment snippets you have created in other devices through the same account.

3. Click the orange `New Project` button on the sidebar to start a new project.

4. In the dialog box that opens, type an appropriate name and description for your project as reference. Click on the blue `create` button to create the project. You can see your new project being promptly added below the `Search` bar.

Voila! You created your first project. To create a module or request inside your project. Click on the newly created project title in the side bar to show the dropdown modal with options to create `Module` or `Request`. Click on the desired link to create the same. Firecamp offers options to manage projects and modules as per your preferences. For more information, read about Managing projects and modules in Firecamp.

Alternatively, you can start working on any of the apps, integrations or utilities available on the homepage of the Firecamp app and later, save that request for file into a project through the `Save` button that is available. For more information, read about saving your first request in Firecamp.

Firecamp also supports a variety of other platforms from which you can import projects and get started quickly. Read more about importing projects to Firecamp.
