# What are Workspaces?
Workspaces in Firecamp are hubs for your projects in which you can work, collaborate and share your work with team members in your organization. Workspaces consist of projects that help you test your 3rd party API's or your own API's that you or your team is working on together. All changes to projects, modules, requests, files, and environment snippets are shared and synced with other teammates working on the same Workspace.

Workspaces are off 2 types:
1. Personal Workspaces are available to only you (The owner of the account) and are private in nature.
2. Organization Workspaces are available to only those team members who have been invited and have the relevant permission to access it.
