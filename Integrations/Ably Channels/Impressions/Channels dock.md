# Channels dock

## Overview 

The channels dock in your Ably Integration is where all your saved channels are displayed. You can access all your saved channels later along with their respective `Subscriptions` and `Publishes`. 

When you click on the `Channels` button, all your saved channels will be displayed. You can click on the round icon to run the channel and communicate with it. Click on the arrow icon to open the channel and inspect the list of Publishes and Subscriptions by clicking on the `Publish` and `Subscribe` buttons respectively. You can also delete a particular Publish/Subscription, or the whole channel itself by clicking on the trash can icon beside the channel/publish/subscribe name.
