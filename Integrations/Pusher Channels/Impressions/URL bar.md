# URL bar

## Overview

The URL bar in the Pusher Integration is the hub area for establishing, modifying and saving connections.

The URL bar is where you can specify your Pusher endpoint in the URL field and click the `Connect` button to establish a connection with your Pusher app. You can save your existing Pusher channel along with its binds and triggers globally by clicking the `Save` button in the URL Bar. By doing so, all the members of the workspace/project/module will be able to see, run and modify the channel in the `Channels dock`.
