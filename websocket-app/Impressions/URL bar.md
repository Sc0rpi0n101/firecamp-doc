# URL bar

## Overview

The URL bar in the WebSocket (WS) app is the hub area for establishing, modifying and saving connections.

The URL bar is where you can specify the server endpoint in the URL field and use the `Connect` button to establish a connection with the WebSockets. The `Default` and `Project` environmental snippets (if working with project) can be easily accessed and selected from the URL bar.

## Configuring Protocols
