# Saved Messages Panel

Writing messages for testing and debugging a WebSocket connection, again and again, is repetitive. Firecamp offers support to `Send & Save` your messages in the `Messages` panel on the right of the WebSocket app.

## Saving your first message

To save messages in Firecamp, type a message in the `MESSAGE` panel at the bottom of the WebSocket app in either of the formats that is `Text` or `JSON`. When you are ready to send, use the `Send & Save` button to send the message to the server as well as save the message in the `messages` panel on the right for easy replication. You can add a `Title` to the messages as well for better navigation later. If no `Title` is mentioned, the system date and time are used as a unique title to the messages saved.

## Managing Saved Messages

Messages saved can be accessed in the `Messages` panel in the form of a numbered list. Messages with the same `Title` are grouped together for better classification. To rename the `Title`, double click on the name to activate a rename input box. After which you can rename your saved messages.

Hovering over the list of Saved Messages will make a downward arrow appear and bin icon appearing against the corresponding message. This can be used to view the messages saved to send them again or delete a message respectively.

To send a saved message again, hover your mouse over the desired Title and click the downward arrow as it appears. Later. hover the mouse over the list of the messages with content, and click the blue `Send` button as it appears over the desired message you want to send. One can also delete the message with the bin icon that appears with every message on which the mouse hovers over for further accessibility.

## Saving the Connection for later use

Saving messages is not the same as saving your WebSocket connection to your project. Saving the WebSocket connection to the project ensures that your work is saved in Firecamp and can be later used by you or your teammates. To save the WebSocket you created, use the `Save` button located next to the blue `Connect` button in the URL bar. Select the project you want to save your WebSocket in and that's it. This will save the WebSocket Connection to the project that you select and will be ready to use as and when required.
