# Convert Data Types using the Firecamp Smart Converter

Modern API's return data most popularly in the form of JSON objects. JSON is a open-standard file format that apart from being human-readable is also used to transmit data objects. As the specifications evolve, more data types become availabe such as YAML and XML. To allow for flexiblity, Firecamp allows data types to be easily converted from one type to another.

## How it works

The smart converter automatically detects the data type that is being used on the left window and converts it accordingly to JSON, XML, and YAML format. In addition to detection of the data type, Firecamp validates the format of the data type and notifies if there are any discrepanices in the form of warnings and errors.

Example: When converting XML into JSON, users have the option to choose the representation of JSON data type as `compact`, `non-compact`, `JSObject` and `Plain`.

To save your conversions, click the `Save` button in the top bar. Do note that you would need to create a project if not already created before to save it.
