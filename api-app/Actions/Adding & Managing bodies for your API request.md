## Adding & Managing bodies for your API request

More than usual, developers like to create more than one body with different types to facilitate faster testing and quick response to their API requests. Well, Firecamp has you covered.

In this action, we will quickly go through examples of all body types Firecamp has to offer for you to play with and experiment with your API.
