## Overview

The response panel in the Firecamp GraphQL app is to view, format and get more information about the response of your request.

The panel provides a clear eagle-eye view of your response body as well as features to dive into headers, cookies, and timeline and performance benchmarks associated with your request.  

> Placeholder for the entire response body. 

The response body can be presented as JSON or text by clicking the toggle buttons below the `Body` tab. With the options to copy, fold as well as word wrap if needed, the GraphQL response body can be viewed and managed as needed.

The response headers, cookies, and timelines for the response can be viewed by toggling through tabs. The `copy json` and `copy text` can be used to copy information in any format that is required.

The performance benchmarks helps get an idea to the user about API performance traits like the status codes, the response time and the data transferred.
