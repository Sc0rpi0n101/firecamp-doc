## Overview

An endpoint is a technical term associated with API's (Application Programming Interface). In general, endpoints are the location where two software programs are allowed to communicate with each other. APIs work by sending requests from a web application or webserver to endpoints and receiving response data in return. In other words, API endpoints are the specific digital locations where requests for information sent by one program are answered and data is returned from where the resource lives. 

GraphQL endpoints are similar to REST and often use the same HTTP(s) transports as REST. However, rather than using various path-based URIs and HTTP verbs, GraphQL endpoint uses a single endpoint with a defined schema that specifies how to not only fetch data but also mutate, or change, data.
